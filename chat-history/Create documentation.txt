Okay, we are on the finish line. Could you please write documentation for the application? I need:
- Application description: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences.
- Information on how to install/run the developed application locally.

Certainly! Here's a documentation for your application:

Contact Manager Application Documentation
Application Description
The Contact Manager Application is a simple, yet efficient, tool designed to manage personal or professional contacts. Built upon the powerful React framework and utilizing Redux for state management, it offers a seamless way to add and display contact details. The primary interface comprises a form to input the contact's first name, last name, email, and a brief message. Once submitted, contacts are listed in a clear, tabular format, providing an organized view of the stored data.

The application boasts built-in validation checks, ensuring data integrity. For instance, it ensures email fields adhere to the conventional format, while also ascertaining that the message field contains at least ten characters. This amalgamation of features makes the Contact Manager a quintessential choice for anyone looking to manage contacts with a modicum of effort.

Installation & Running Locally
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine. If not, you can download and install them from here.

Steps:

Clone the Repository:
First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone [Your Repository URL]
Navigate to the Directory:
Change your directory to the cloned application's root folder:

bash
Copy code
cd path-to-cloned-directory
Install Dependencies:
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server:
With all dependencies installed, you can now start the development server using:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Accessing the Application:
Once the development server is up, open a web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Here, you should see the Contact Manager Application running smoothly.

Remember to replace [Your Repository URL] with the actual URL of your repository. This documentation assumes the default port (3000) for running the application. Adjust it if you're using a different port.

Okay, let's turn off the fantasy and do not call that application "Contact Manager Application Documentation". So do it again, but describe the application only from a technical standpoint and do not imply any use cases. You have all the required information in this dialog.

Absolutely. Let's keep it technical and direct.

Redux Contact Form Application Documentation
Application Description
This application is a React-based web interface built with Redux for state management. It consists of two primary components: a form and a data list display. The form component captures four fields: first name, last name, email, and a message. Data input undergoes validation processes using the validator package to ensure correctness, such as verifying that the email field conforms to standard formats and that the message has a minimum character length. Once the form's data passes the validation checks and is submitted, it's dispatched to the Redux store. The data list component retrieves and presents the stored data in a tabular format, fetching the data directly from the Redux store.

Installation & Running Locally
Prerequisites:
Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine. If they aren't, they can be obtained from nodejs.org.

Steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [Repository URL]
Navigate to the Directory:
Move into the application's root directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path-to-directory
Install Dependencies:
Execute the following command to pull in required dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Run the Development Server:
Initiate the local development server using:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Open in Browser:
By default, the application should be accessible at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Note: Ensure you replace [Repository URL] with the actual repository's URL. If you have any non-default configurations (like a port different from 3000), make the necessary adjustments in the documentation.

# Redux Contact Form Application Documentation

## Application Description
This application is a React-based web interface built with Redux for state management. It consists of two primary components: a form and a data list display. The form component captures four fields: first name, last name, email, and a message. Data input undergoes validation processes using the `validator` package to ensure correctness, such as verifying that the email field conforms to standard formats and that the message has a minimum character length. Once the form's data passes the validation checks and is submitted, it's dispatched to the Redux store. The data list component retrieves and presents the stored data in a tabular format, fetching the data directly from the Redux store.

## Installation & Running Locally

### Prerequisites:
Ensure `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine. If they aren't, they can be obtained from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```
   git clone [Repository URL]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**  
   Move into the application's root directory:
   ```
   cd path-to-directory
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Execute the following command to pull in required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**  
   Initiate the local development server using:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open in Browser:**  
   By default, the application should be accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

Just replace [Repository URL] with your actual repository's URL, and path-to-directory with the actual path if needed.
